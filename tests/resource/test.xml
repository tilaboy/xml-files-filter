   Experience


 Internships:             • February-August  2017 (6 months)   at Apsys-Airbus (IT security audit company)    ,
                            Toulouse
                            The purpose of this internship was to evaluate the available and implementable
                            solutions in order to create a unidirectional Ethernet connection. To simplify the
                            certification of the solution, priority was given to hardware solutions, which implied to
                            physically cut wires. The internship led to a prototyped demonstration on a
                            Raspberry Pi board.
                          • Summer 2016 :   2.5 months  at IDA (research institute), TU Braunschweig  , Germany
                            Python  implementation of a random, parameterized   system generator    from an
                            existing project in Java. The generator was intended to provide a hardware platform
                            and software applications in the field of embedded systems to evaluate the
                            performance of scheduling, mapping or verification algorithms.
                          • Summer 2015 :   4 weeks,  Particule Physics Center in Marseille
                            Operator at the library of research laboratory
Scholar projects:
                          • Implementation of a hardware accelerator   on FPGA   for the Simon encryption
                            algorithm from the NSA (project just started in October).
                          • Implementation of a Semi-direct Visual Odometry     (SVO) experiment using  Robot
                            OS  on an Odroid-C2 board   . The experiment was embedded on a    handmade
                            drone . The SVO algorithm was developed by the uzh-rpg.
                          • Implementation of a Deca  compiler  in Java during an intensive month in a team.
                          • Several projects in C : games, memory management, threads, creation of process,
                            basic kernel for i386 processor.
                          • Project for the startup Enerstone and my engineering school. Creation of a state of
                            charge display of a battery on a STM32F0 board  .
